## Quick Reference

| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Word count | `wc -w content/**/*.md` |
| Find placeholders | `rg "TODO\|TBD\|PLACEHOLDER" content/` |
| Check terminology | Compare against style/terminology.md |
| Verify facts | Cross-reference research/notes.md |

## Loop Workflow

**Each section = 1 planning loop + N writing loops**

| Loop | Prompt | Task |
|------|--------|------|
| 0 | PLANNING_PROMPT | Research section, generate page breakdown |
| 1-N | PROMPT | Write one page (~1000 words) |

**After each loop:** Update editorial_plan.md, then STOP.

**Source of truth:**
- outline/structure.md → Section topics (what to cover)
- editorial_plan.md → Current page breakdown (generated by PLANNING_PROMPT)

## Content Conventions

**File naming:**
- Section folders: `section-01/`, `section-02/`, etc.
- Page files: `page-01.md`, `page-02.md`, etc.

**Marking incomplete sections:**
```markdown
<!-- STATUS: INCOMPLETE - needs examples -->
<!-- TODO: Add more detail -->
```

## Quality Checklist

Before marking a section complete:

- [ ] Matches outline scope and purpose
- [ ] Voice consistent with style guide
- [ ] Terminology matches glossary
- [ ] Facts verified against research
- [ ] No placeholder text remaining
- [ ] Transitions flow smoothly
- [ ] Appropriate length

## Learnings

> Add discoveries here as you write

- {LEARNING - add as you discover effective patterns}

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Section too long | Break into subsections, add headers |
| Tone inconsistent | Re-read previous sections before writing |
| Missing transitions | Add bridge sentences between topics |
| Passive voice creep | Search for "was/were/been" and revise |
