# Plan.md Update Instructions

- Keep @plan.md as an ordered checklist of remaining work.
- Use this canonical task-line format for every plan item:
  `- [ ] [P1][M][T17] <task description>`
- Required tags:
  - Priority: `P0|P1|P2|P3`
  - Complexity: `S|M|L`
  - Task ID: `T<number>` (unique per file, stable once created)
- Mark completed items with `[x]` and keep unfinished items `[ ]`.
- Add new items when you discover missing work; keep them scoped and concrete.
- Append a short session summary at the end of each loop with what changed and why.
