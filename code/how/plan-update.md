# Plan.md Update Instructions

- Keep @plan.md as an ordered checklist of remaining work.
- Mark completed items with `[x]` and keep unfinished items `[ ]`.
- Add new items when you discover missing work; keep them scoped and concrete.
- Append a short session summary at the end of each loop with what changed and why.
